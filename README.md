# Rendez-Zoo

## Welcome!

Rendez-Zoo is a near-faithful clone of Meetup.com (for non-human animals) that I
created for my capstone project to demonstrate fluency and proficiency in the
various programming languages, frameworks, and libraries used.

I chose a single-page design over the actual multi-page layout of the source
material to better leverage my infrastructural limitations. With JSON's
lightweight footprint, all server and database requests take place quickly and
asynchronously in order to provide the most responsive user experience possible.

## Well what did you use?
